# Bible Time üìñüïí
*BIBLE IN 60 DAYS!*

## About 
This repo is the builder and resulting HTML Bible reordered for the Bible Time reading plan.  
The order of the books of the Bible has been reordered in ascending order based on the length of the book.

This is the textual equivalent to the [Bible Time Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtSSGOpcW4_2iOD-S-4_ycuSJJRvXkeP-)

## The Plan
The Bible Time playlist is the Bible reordered by length of book. Listen from the shortest to the longest book thru the whole Bible in 60 days! 
The first 14 books in an hour! 44 books are under an hour long, 3rd John is just a long paragraph! Mentally this feels like progress and it is! 
By the time you get to longer books, you're invested and soon done! Christians don't read Obadiah typically, or give up at Leviticus... 
BUT read in a new order and see books like never before! End with the big books, at most only a couple hours and by the end you WANT to finish, 
you've read 90% of the Bible! I pray the Lord gives you ears to hear His perfect Word!
